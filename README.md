# Dear Recruiters

Firstly, thank You for having me! I have taken part in many recruitment processes, but I have never seen a company using Rick and Morty API for recruitment task. I think the task was amazing and I had a lot of fun doing it.ðŸ˜€

## Branches

I decided Iâ€™m going to make two versions with different state management solutions.

- `main`: This branch uses React Context.
- `zustand`: This branch uses [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).
